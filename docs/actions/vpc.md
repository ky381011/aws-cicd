Terraform setting is
```terraform
resource "aws_vpc" "test_vpc"{
  cidr_block           = "172.16.0.0/20"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  tags = {
    Name = "tf_test"
  }
}
```

This .tf file set cidr_block  
  
And, terraform is used in GitHub Actions as
```yaml
- name: Setup Terraform
  uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3

- name: Terraform Init
  working-directory: src/vpc
  run: terraform init

- name: Terraform Plan
  working-directory: src/vpc
  run: terraform plan -out=tfplan

- name: Terraform Apply
  working-directory: src/vpc
  run: terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
```

Files generated by terraform can't be seen because environment was deleted emmediately
